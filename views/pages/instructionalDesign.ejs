                My development skills coupled with my experience as an educator for Digital
                Technologies curriculums create the perfect mix for technical content creation. As a
                result, I've recently stumbled upon the job title of "Instructional Designer", which
                I think sums up my skills perfectly as I often design, create and/or deliver
                technical courses.

                    She Codes is a startup, based in Perth, that is on a mission to teach women
                    coding skills, get women into technical careers, and build communities of
                    like-minded women. Our vision is to increase diversity in tech by inspiring
                    100,000 women across Australia by 2025.

                    I am the Technical and Education lead for She Codes. The content I design,
                    create and deliver is aimed at beginners, so the most difficult part about this
                    role is making sure we push the students out of their comfort zone, but not too
                    far as to scare them away from tech. It's a challenging balance to maintain, so
                    I am constantly adapting and improving our content.

                <p>
                    At Student Edge I was the Learning Coordinator. I worked with experts in a range
                    of different fields, to produce educational content for students, focused on the
                    life skills not taught at school.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My primary role was to be the liason between the learning providers (experts)
                    and Student Edge, and to make sure that the content produced was of a high
                    standard, suitable for our platform, and relevant for the students using it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This role relied heavily on my experience as an Instructional Designer, as well
                    as my background of working in both the education and technology industries.

                    At Firefly I was involved with designing and creating a program for educating
